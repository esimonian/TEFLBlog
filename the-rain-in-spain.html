My best friend (who also had 9am Monday/Wednesday phonetics classes and was the same kind of nerd as me) and I would pass notes in IPA in class. Not for any reason. Just <strong>for funsies</strong>. Surprisingly, we also both got laid in college.</p><p>To be fair, it is a really cool system. The way that IPA works is that each SOUND has exactly one symbol that describes it. And no, that’s not how any “regular” alphabet works. English is especially terrible for that. What sound does a <strong>c</strong> make? What about an <strong>a</strong>? Or even better, the Chomskiest of all Linguistics jokes.</p><blockquote><p>“How do you spell fish?”</p><p>“ghoti - gh ais in laugh, o as in women, and ti as in function.”</p><p>ba-dum-tis (cymbal noise)</p></blockquote><p>So what IPA does is allow you a system to transcribe the exact SOUNDS of anything.</p><p>It’s precise, it’s gorgeous, you can be as broad or as nitpicky with your transcriptions as you like, and it is 100% logical. I was hooked. I wanted to teach THE WHOLE WORLD IPA. My friend and did actually do a thesis where we taught IPA to ESL students in a classroom and see how their pronunciation skills improved. It was insane.</p><p>Eventually I grew up and realized that it’s not always feasible to teach language-learners an entirely new alphabet AS WELL as an entirely new language. But if you’re a language nerd, a pronunciation fanatic, want to know what dictionary pronunciation is, or you are trying to learn an accent it is a priceless tool.</p><p>I use IPA a lot in this blog, but generally in the broader sense. a word bounded by slashes - /slash/ is phonemic transcription - the most generally recognized way to transcribe. It doesn’t bother with diacritics like aspiration, dental or apical co-articulation, or releases. That’s phonetic transcription, and it’s generally marked by [brackets].</p><p>I at some point will probably talk about all the cool shit hidden in IPA and phonetics, like syllabified m and n, the ridiculous amount of fricatives hiding in English, and the sounds that we DON’T have in the English language. Maybe I’ll also tell the story of how I cockblocked some guy with linguistics knowledge LIKE A BOSS.</p><p>Right now, we’re focusing on IPA and English phonetics in general though.</p><h2 id="how-kind-of-you-to-let-me-come">How Kind Of You To Let Me Come</h2><p>English is generally divided into consonants and vowels. We have around ten vowels, and around 21 consonants. This is a subject of <strong>huge debate</strong> among phoneticists though. is the sound a “w” makes a consonant, a glide, or a vowel? I DONT CARE IT’S NEAT.</p><p>Consonants are classified by the place of articulation in the mouth, the manner of airflow constriction, and voicing.</p><p>Vowels are classified along four axis of front/back, high/low, round/unround and a mystery axis tense/lax.</p><p>Here are some normal words written in IPA. Primary stress is marked with a superscript tick-mark ‘ and secondary stress (if it exists) is marked with a subscript tick-mark ˌ.</p><p>/əˈlon/</p><p>/ɪmˈpɹɛ-ʃɪn/</p><p>/ˈlɛk-ʃəɹ/</p><p>/rəˈpli:t/</p><p>/ˌsʌ-pləˈmɛn-tʃɹi/</p><p>/ˈlæpˌtɑp/</p><p>/ædˈmɪ-ʃən/</p><p>/ˈlæɾ-ɪˌtu:d/</p><p>/əˌlɑŋˈsaɪd/</p><p>/ˌɛ-pəˈlɛp-tɪk/</p><p>Now I’m going to do some weird trivia.</p><h2 id="with-blackest-moss-the-flowerpots">With Blackest Moss The Flowerpots</h2><p>ch /tʃ/ is realy a fast t - sh sound.</p><p>j /dʒ/ is really a fast d - ʒ (that squiggly letter is the ge sound in mirage) sound.</p><p>Affricates are neat. They start out as plosives/stops/whatever you want to call them, where the airflow is entirely blocked. And then they really quickly become fricatives - the sounds that you can hum forever.</p><h2 id="moses-supposes-erroneously">Moses Supposes Erroneously</h2><p>We have three nasal sounds in English - those are sounds where air is blown through the nasal cavity as well as the mouth. You can recognize them because they are the sounds it is impossible to say when you have a stuffy nose.</p><p>We have a bilabial nasal plosive, /m/.</p><p>We have an alveolar nasal plosive, /n/.</p><p>And we have a velar nasal plosive /ŋ/.</p><p>/ŋ/ is the “ng” sound, and you can remember it because it looks like an “ng” squished together. It’s the sound at the end of “singing”. It is in fact, one sound though. We don’t really notice in English because it cannot occur word-initially so we don’t think about it as a real sound independent of orthography. But LOTS of other languages do have this sound word-initially, and it is one of the first stumbling blocks that English-speakers have when learning phonetics. (Let’s not even get go into the uvular trill or pharyngeal sounds.)</p><p>Thankfully, I learned to pronounce this fairly early in undergrad, as it’s a SUPER prominent sound in Thai. It’s the letter ง, and is the first sound in งู /ŋu:/, snake.</p><h1 id="wouldnt-it-be-loverly">Wouldn’t It Be Loverly</h1><p>As continuing evidence for my obsession with the phonetic alphabet, my web dev friend and I are making you an app so that you too can type in IPA whenever the mood strikes you. We will shortly have available an IPA keyboard compatible with iphone and ipad for all of your transcription, secret-note-passing, accent-learning, or language-teaching needs.</p></section><footer class="post-footer"> <figure class="author-image"> <a class="img" href="/author/Monk1" style="background-image:url('/assets/images/jaqlargehead.jpg')"><span class="hidden">'s Picture</span></a> </figure><section class="author"><h4><a href="/author/Monk1">Jaqueline Steiger</a></h4><p> Complaining and measuring horses.
