<strong>Clauses</strong> are a thing. We're not talking about them yet.

<strong>Basically</strong> we try to organize information from the beginning to the end. While we don't have topic markers, it can be assumed in English that the first part of the sentence is common knowledge or is at least setting the listener up to hear new information.

## Types of Constituents

1) **Noun phrases** - consist of a noun or an article/adjective noun, or even a relative clause, but in general are all about a single thing. ex) the dog that bit me, a really old car.

2) **Verb phrases** - the same but for verbs. don't recommend staying, goes with.

3) **preposition phrases** - begin with a preposition and then contain a noun phrase. On the corner, with many additional features.

4) **adjective phrase** - contain an adjective, which can follow one or more adverbs, 

5) **Adverb phrases** - contain an adverb which can also follow MORE ADVERBS

## Functions

1) **Subjects**

2) **Direct Objects**

3) **Complements** - usually tell us something about the subject. Could be a noun phrase, adjective phrase, preposition phrase, or another clause. She became <u>a nicer person</u>. Complement verbs usually don't make sense on their own (was, become).

4) **Indirect Objects**  - don't forget double object stuff also. This all makes sense to me because Spanish conveniently marks all of its objects and object pronouns. Apparently it might be easier to teach some indirect objects as adverbials. "she told the truth <u>to her husband</u>."

WTF is the difference between objects and complements? We can distinguish them in terms of meaning. Objects refer to different things than subjects. Complements refer back to the subject. 

> "She bought a car." 
>
> "She became a celebrity."

The first has an object, the second has a complement. Another good test is that sentences with objects can be restructured into the passive voice and sentences with complements cannot. 

5) **Adverbials** are apparently a mystery. They can be PP, AdvP, or NP and usually begin with a preposition. They're optional information we can add to a clause, and we can string a bunch together. They could also be an entire clause. Good.

6) **Coordinating Conjunctions** what's your function? Hookin' up words and phrases and clauses. And but or.

## Conclusion

Now they tell me. Sentences consist of a subject and a predicate. Predicates can be verb phrases, indirect objects, direct objects, double objects, or complements. All of this can also be based on the type of verb we choose, which are eponymous to the predicate type.

## Extra Bits

**Dummy subjects** are like null subjects or the null letter in thai. They don't contribute to the meaning, but they are necessary for syntax. Take that, Chomsky. "It's raining."

**Hay** is its own grammatical construction in English - "there is"/"there are". They don't follow any other rules and are confusing.

**Separated verb phrases** are a thing we do sometimes.

**Spoken English** changes all these rules based on the whims of its mercurial speakers. Another problem for teachers and the model/real speech gap. See <u>On Model Speech.</u>
