My newest textbook is “The Lexical Approach” and its core principle is here: 

> “**The lexical approach** is a method of teaching foreign languages described by Michael Lewis in the early 1990s. The basic concept on which this **approach**rests is the idea that an important part of learning a language consists of being able to understand and produce **lexical** phrases as chunks.”

So it’s bottom-up as opposed to top-down and is sort of how my program that I’m in approaches ESL teaching. I’m INTERESTED, but I’m not already drinking the Kool-Aid yet. I was definitely p-type and not s-type in school, but there’s also only so much communicative competence you can demonstrate by shouting individual words in random orders. 

Interested in hearing what other word nerds think about the Lexical Approach, since I never read it in undergrad. Maybe @dedalvs?

#### Some Context

I’m starting the DELTA, which is a post-grad program for teaching ESL teachers. Eventually I want to set up a TEFL school - not to teach children English, but to teach the teachers HOW to teach children English, and this is the certification I need to do that.

##### Even More Context

I actually don't start DELTA Module 1 until September 12th. Why am I reading the textbooks a month in advance? Because I have a full-time job and another part time job and the course supposedly adds 15-20 hours of work a week to my 40-hour-a-week teaching job and my 15-hour-a-week remot production coordinating job. I want to get the jump on these textbooks so that I don't succumb to exhaustion like an old-school lady protagonist.
