### They're super bullshit

So adverbs are apparently the "catch-all" part of speech, according to the grammar textbook I am having an increasingly contentious relationship with. They aren't just "words that modify the verb". Let's go into what the book says, partially so that there's an adverbs list up here on the blog and partially so that I memorize the different kinds of adjectives.

### Adverbs of Manner

They express how something is done. Most commonly they go after a verb, after an object, or after an "adverbial", which is apparently just a phrase that acts as an adverb.

"You spoke **convincingly**."

"You described everything to the Board of Directors **passionately**."

"She **carefully** put the Emmy back on the shelf."

But then they also contradict themselves and they can go BEFORE all of those things.  Also, they can qualify adjectives, i.e. "**loosely** assembled notes" which doesn't sound weird or difficult to understand to me, since "loosely" is modifying assembled. You know, the verb. Okay I guess it's an adjective in the bigger sentence but since this is just a fragment, and assembled is a participle, it *makes sense in my head leave me alone*.

### Adverbs of Frequency

always, usually, hardly ever (so British), rarely, never, etc. These guys can go pretty much wherever depending. That's not true, but they say they have no good way to explain this to language learners, so whatever.

### Adverbs of Time and Place

here, there, down, on Wednesday, underneath.

Including the tricky bastards *already, still* and *yet*. The textbook basically threw up its hands and said "These can only be explained in context, and you're going to have to do it in the speaker's native language." 

Oh, here we go. Later on in the chapter they remind us that *yet* usually goes with negative sentences and *already* usually goes with positive ones. 

### Adverbs of Degree

"He scribbled **furiously**."

"I am **very** hungry."

Categorized needlessly into intensifires and downtowners. Possibly the most British of all adverbs, downtowners aren't really a thing unless you're trying to be rude. 

"You swam **fairly** well."

### Adverbs of Quantity

A little, a lot, and much. 

'Nuff said.

### Focusing Adverbs

Even, only, and also. 

They sort of single out information or express a restriction of meaning of the verb.

### Attitude Markers

I don't know if these are a real thing. Naturally, clearly, hopefully, fortunately. I guess they mark that the sentence expressed afterwards is an opinion, because it signifies the speaker's position on the event. 

### Adverbs Are Sometimes -ly But Not Always

Great. Helpful. Thanks.
