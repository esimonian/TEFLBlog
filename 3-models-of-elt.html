And there seems to be some evidence of regression - once a student has internalized a rule and goes on to do something else, they might synthesize that old rule incorrectly.</p><p>Here are three conflicting theories about language learning:</p><h2 id="behaviourism">Behaviourism</h2><p>With the British “u” and everything. This is based on modeling and imitation, and requires positive reinforcement and corrective strategies. Based off behavioural psychology, which was essentially a “pics or it didn’t happen” branch of psych.</p><p>This branch of learning stresses listening, repetition, imitation, and correction, as well as the acquisition of generative structures in a linear fashion.</p><p>Obviously the backlash to this produced:</p><h2 id="the-innatist-perspective">The Innatist Perspective</h2><p>Dammit, Noam. Stay out of this. So this one is the idea of the Universal Grammar and Generative Grammar and a lot of Noam Nonsense. It’s got good points, in that babies can’t have heard every speech utterance. There has to be SOME sort of internal language system.</p><p>Neither of these two systems are perfect, though.</p><h4 id="side-note-for-krashen">Side Note for Krashen</h4><p>Krashen is the guy the <em>The Lexical Approach</em> author has a huge hard-on for. He suggests:</p><blockquote><p>“there was an essential difference between learning and acquisition, the former being akin to the conscious learning one does in class, the latter being largely unconscious and at a deeper, more permanent level. It also proposed that acquired language gave rise to spontaneous production (<em>fluency</em>), whereas learned language would be more deliberate, consciously produced, probably for a pedagogical or other formal purpose (<em>accuracy</em>).</p><p>A related hypothesis proposed that learners used a monitor to check what the accuracy and appropriateness of what they were saying, sometimes consciously, often unconsciously.”</p></blockquote><p>He also had the idea of the affective filter, the novel concept that things that are engaging and low-stress are easier to learn. Shocking.</p><p>Now that we’re in the 21st century and everything has to be goddamn interdisciplinary all the time, we’re moving towards many</p><h2 id="cognitive-perspectives">Cognitive Perspectives</h2><p>There’s <strong>Information Processing Theory</strong>, “the idea of cognitive effort, which in turn involves attention, processing and automatisation”.</p><p>There’s <strong>Declarative and Proceduarl Learning</strong>, concepts that are basically “knowledge that” and “knowledge how”. Thanks, cog sci. This is super groundbreaking.</p><p>The <strong>Interaction Hypothesis</strong> is another one that someone got to claim but is really self-explanatory:</p><blockquote><ol><li><p>Interactional modification makes input comprehensible </p></li><li><p>Comprehensible input promotes acquisition </p></li><li><p>Therefore interactional modification promotes acquisition</p></li></ol></blockquote><p>And then there’s the <strong>Sociocultural Approach</strong> which says that learning doesn’t happen in a vacuum and prioritizes the social event:</p><blockquote><p>…emphasising the social event rather than the internal goings-on in the mind. Thus, student and tutor, or student and student co-constructed meaning in acting out an interactive event, with the learning arising out of the event itself, and the co-operation between the interactants.</p><p>The nature of input was important: it had to be interesting, challenging but not so difficult that it led to frustration. In short, it had to be focused and carefully graded – proximal to the stage of the learner’s stage of development. The theory went that deeper processing occurs when a learner is focused on what they are hearing from their interlocutor and while they are formulating their response. The process of production or output supposedly aids deeper understanding.</p></blockquote></section><footer class="post-footer"> <figure class="author-image"> <a class="img" href="/author/Monk1" style="background-image:url('/assets/images/jaqlargehead.jpg')"><span class="hidden">'s Picture</span></a> </figure><section class="author"><h4><a href="/author/Monk1">Jaqueline Steiger</a></h4><p> Complaining and measuring horses.
