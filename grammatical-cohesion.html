Not super sure why it needed its own word for that, it seems like a tautology to me. Pieces of text can and should be analyzed as text. The book is even more vague about it.</p><blockquote><p>“<strong>textuality</strong>, that is, the feeling that something is a text, and not just a random collection of sentences.”</p></blockquote><p>Cool. Thanks, I guess. Textuality is more of a <em>feeling</em> than a helpful definition.</p><p><strong>Cohesion</strong> and grammatical cohesion are easier to understand for me.</p><blockquote><p>“The grammar of English offers a limited set of options for creating surface links between clauses and sentences of a text. Basically, most texts display links from sentence to sentence.”</p></blockquote><p>Essentially, a text wouldn’t go “I went to the park to see the squirrels. An alien took over the city.” and then continue on about the park/squirrel story without addressing the alien story.</p><p>There’s a few (three-ish) helper concepts in the support of grammatical cohesion.</p><h3 id="reference">Reference</h3><p>Reference items include pronouns, articles, and demonstratives, as well as a few weird preposition-type-dudes. References point from one part of a text to another.</p><blockquote><p>“The schoolhouse had a red roof with a small chimney. <u>It</u> was cold in the summer and hot in the winter.”</p></blockquote><p>It obviously applies to the schoolhouse, linking the two sentences together. Looking backwards in the text like that is called <u>anaphoric reference</u>.</p><p>References to assumed, shared worlds outside the text are <u>exophoric references</u>. These references will be shared by the speaker and audience, and are generally part of cultural awareness or the zeitgeist. “Things in the US are tense, until the election”. If the audience is reading the sentence in the time it’s written, they probably wouldn’t ask “which election?”</p><p>References that point to parts of the text we haven’t experienced yet are called <u>cataphoric references</u>. These often involve pronouns but can also involved definite articles.</p><h3 id="ellipsis">Ellipsis</h3><p><u>Ellipsis</u> is a weird word. Also, <u>Ellipsis</u> is the omission of elements normally required by the grammar which the speaker/writer assumes are obvious from the context and therefore need not be raised. This isn’t just “everything in a text must be spelled out at all times” - that’s unnatural speech and how you know someone is an alien and/or robot. Specifically, ellipsis is distinguished by the <em>structure</em> of the discourse having some missing elements.</p><blockquote><p>“The children will carry the small boxes, the adults the large ones”.</p></blockquote><p>“will carry” is omitted in the second clause because it can be assumed from the first clause.</p><p>There are three kinds of ellipsis in English, <u>nominal</u>, <u>clausal</u>, and <u>verbal</u>, referring to what is being omitted.</p><h5 id="we-care-about-ellipsis-because">We care about ellipsis because</h5><p>it creates difficulties in learning. Not only in learning what structural omissions are permissible, but also it doesn’t seem to be readily used even by proficient learners in situations where native speakers naturally resort to it.</p><p>Weird.</p><p><u>Substitution</u> is also similar to ellipsis, but it’s the use of new words instead of just omitting. “Do you want a chocolate?” “Just <strong>one</strong>.” “Who likes pizza rolls?” “I <strong>do</strong>!”</p><p>This kind of shit is not easily and directly transferrable to another language, so it’s weirdly fascinating to me.</p><h3 id="conjunction">Conjunction</h3><p>Is apparently cheating to include during our talk of grammatical cohesion? I don’t know why the book needs to tell me this. A <u>conjunction</u> does not set off a search backward or forward for its referent, but it does presuppose a textual sequence, and signals a relationship between segments of the discourse.</p><p>These can be the literal conjunction parts of speech, a metatextual phrase (on the other hand), or a lexical item somewhere else in the clause.</p><p>Some nerd has categorized conjunctions into <em>elaboration, extension</em> and <em>enhancement</em>.</p></section><footer class="post-footer"> <figure class="author-image"> <a class="img" href="/author/Monk1" style="background-image:url('/assets/images/jaqlargehead.jpg')"><span class="hidden">'s Picture</span></a> </figure><section class="author"><h4><a href="/author/Monk1">Jaqueline Steiger</a></h4><p> Complaining and measuring horses.
